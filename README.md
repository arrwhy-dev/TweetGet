TweetGet
========

A simple twitter search app that queries the twitter API for a list of tweets.

A user sets a default hashtag to query for and the app will automatically pull down the related tweets on the app's main page.

Users can also search for any hashtag to receive a list of tweets

The app features a variety of settings which allow for:
<ul>
<li>Tweet caching/off-line mode</li>
<li>Specific the number of tweets to load by default</li>
<li>Specific the type of tweets you'd like to receive (popular, recent, mixed)</li>
</ul>





The project is simple and is updated every now and then, most of the time I can't make up my mind on particular features and end up scrapping them. 
I'll eventually branch out those experimental release into their own git branches.


The app was originally built using twitter's API v1.0, but since it's deprecation the app utilizes 
the v1.1 API and it's use of OAUTH.
