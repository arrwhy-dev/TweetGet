TweetGet
========

A simple twitter search app that queries the twitter api for a list of tweets.

A user sets a default hashtag to query for and the app will automatically  pull down the related tweets on the app's
main page.

Users can also search for any hashtag to receive a list of tweets

The app features a variety of settins which allow for:
<ul>
<li>Tweet caching/offiline mode</li>
<li>Specific the number of tweets to load by default</li>
<li>Specific the type of tweets you'd like to recieve lar, recent, mixed)</li>
</ul>


The project is simple and is updated with new features every now and then when I find free time.
